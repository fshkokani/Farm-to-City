# Field-to-City
Work in progress.

Full Stack E-Commerce project.
This repository holds the frontend, with a collection of pages:
from store front to product to shopping cart.
Also it holds a page listing all inventory with a full crud capability.
The backend was built through Springboot connecting to SQL database.
This project will be soon hosted on Heroku.
